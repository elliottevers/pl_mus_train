This is the real-time training component of an ambitious ear training project - it's main function is to, given raw audio and its corresponding musical properties, iterate over the song, accept user input, evaluate how well a user completes a set of tasks, and deliver feedback in real-time. A video demo of the project can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW2PdRcoAPk)
